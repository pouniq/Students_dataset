I gathered in detail the grades of each students and made an index to evaluate each lesson separately and made it into one Cohesive dataset 
the question im asking here are:

- Which exams were difficult for the kids? 📎
Which exams were easy?
- Does having a phone affect grades? 📱
- Does having a personal computer affect grades? 💻
- Does having siblings affect grades? 👪
- Does support of parents affect the kids grades ? 👨‍👦
- What do Persian scores have to do with writing ? 🇮🇷
- What do math scores have to do with sciences ? ❗

this is a real world dataset that i gathered for usecase of only Research
i changed the students name to respect their privacy

in Iran education system in elementary schools we have metrics in 4 groups :
- very good : (khili khob) / خیلی خوب
- good : (khob) / خوب 
- acceptable : (ghabel ghabol) / قابل قبوم
- Need more effort : (niaz be talash bishar) / نیاز به تلاش بیشتر

in this case I value very good with 4 , good with 3 , acceptable with 2 and Need more effort with 1
and sum of this numbers give us The Index number that we want for the lesson and then we use that index number in our central dataset to have a one continuous dataset to work on.
