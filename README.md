# Iranian Elementary School Grade Analysis
A research project analyzing student performance based on grades, family factors, and technology access.

## 📌 Overview
This dataset contains anonymized elementary school grades from Iran's education system, converted into a numerical index for analysis.

I gathered in detail the grades of each students and made an index to evaluate each lesson separately and made it into one Cohesive dataset 
the question im asking here are:

- Which exams were difficult for the kids? 📎
Which exams were easy?
- Does having a phone affect grades? 📱
- Does having a personal computer affect grades? 💻
- Does having siblings affect grades? 👪
- Does support of parents affect the kids grades ? 👨‍👦
- What do Persian scores have to do with writing ? 🇮🇷
- What do math scores have to do with sciences ? ❗

### Exam Difficulty
Which subjects were hardest/easiest for students? 📚

### Technology Impact
- 📱 Phone ownership effect on grades
- 💻 Personal computer access effect

### Family Factors
- 👪 Sibling influence on performance
- 👨‍👦 Parental support correlation

### Subject Relationships
- 🇮🇷 Persian vs. Writing skills linkage-
- ➗ Math vs. Science performance connection

this is a real world dataset that i gathered for usecase of only Research
i changed the students name to respect their privacy

in Iran education system in elementary schools we have metrics in 4 groups :

| Persian Grade  | English Translation | Numerical Value |  
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|  
| خیلی خوب       | Very Good           | 4               |  
| خوب            | Good                | 3               |  
| قابل قبول      | Acceptable          | 2               |  
| نیاز به تلاش بیشتر | Needs More Effort | 1               |  


in this case I value very good with 4 , good with 3 , acceptable with 2 and Need more effort with 1
and sum of these numbers give us The Index number that we want for the lesson and then we use that index number in our central dataset to have a one continuous dataset to work on.
