I gathered in detail the grades of each students and made an index to evaluate each lesson separately and made it into one Cohesive dataset 
the question im asking here are:

- Which exams were difficult for the kids?
Which exams were easy?
- Does having a phone affect grades?
- Does having siblings affect grades?
- Does support of parents affect the kids grades ?
- What do Persian scores have to do with writing ?
- What do math scores have to do with sciences ?

this is a real world dataset that i gathered for usecase of only Research
i changed the students name to respect their privacy
